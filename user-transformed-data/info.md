Place input data for subtype predictions here.

This must be data that:

1) Uses TMP project feature names (gene names are 
updated to the exact TMP feature names). If not, then run script 
tools/convert.py as seen in the [Tutorial](tutorial/README.md).

2. Has been quantile rescaled. If not, then run script run_transfrom.sh as 
seen in the [Tutorial](tutorial/README.md).
