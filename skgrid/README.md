# Predicted Subtype Probabilities
Most models return the prediction probability for each subtype, where the overall predicted subtype is the one with the highest probability for the given sample. Due to the nature of the machine learning algorithm (ex. SVC, Passive aggressive, SGD, etc.) a few that do not return prediction probabilities will return only the overall predicted subtype.
