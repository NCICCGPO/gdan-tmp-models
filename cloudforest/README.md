### Files
`prediction file` will end in preds.tsv (full name `<cancer>_<platform>_cloudforest_preds.tsv`) contains the results. Columns 1-3 indicate the sampleID, predicted subtype, and actual subtype. Note the actual subtype column will be NA if the subtypes aren't provided by the user (this will be most use cases).
> Note the actual subtype column will be NA if the subtypes aren't provided by the user (this will be most user cases).

`.sf file` is the model file extension. This is automatically generated by CloudForest and is associated with the top model.


### Model Notations
`MULTI` stands for using all available data types, `ALL` stands for using
all data for one datatype like gene expression.

An `OVERALL` folder was added in each cohort folder, which has the best model
for the cohort. When the `OVERALL` best was `MULTI` type, there will be a `MULTI`
folder in that tissue folder.

**Meaning that not all cancer cohorts have a MULTI model** this only occurs if it is the best overall for that particular cancer cohort.
